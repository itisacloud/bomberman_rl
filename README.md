# Current ToDos:
- finish agent code:
  - set up NN, play around with the layers, the ones from the tutorial might not be the best.
  - handle caching, function to sample cache
  - how to handle checkpoints

+ features:
  - implement wayfinding (a_star)
  - moving kernels? (window_method)
  - cluster coins? (idw_map)
  - how to handle players with diffrent amount of points (maybe target players with higher points?)
  - killing an opponent
  - less features is a better idea (better idea)
  -> calculating feature importance (random forest)
  -> droping a feature from a certain of predictors
